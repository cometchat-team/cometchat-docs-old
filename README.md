## Questions

1. How to create those category drop-down and version drop-down for two separate sections?

   - by providing an object like that in the `docs_list.json`, you gonna defined a category with 1 version:

     ```json
     {
       "id": "first-first-category",
       "path": "docs/first-first-category",
       "routeBasePath": "/first-first-category",
       "lastVersion": "current",
       "versions": {
         "current": {
           "label": "2.2.3"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - Create a `your_new_docs_title + _versioned_docs` folder _(as in first-first-category_versioned_docs)_ and place your docs in it. all your new docs versions gonna be placed there: [check the official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning)
   - create a `your_new_docs_title + _versioned_sidebars` file _(as in first-first-category_versioned_sidebars)_ and place your sidebar in it. all your new docs versions gonna be placed there: [check the official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning)
   - create a file where you gonna defined the list of your versions: `your_new_docs_title + _versions.json` _(as in first-first-category_versions.json)_

2. How to create multiple API pages with different postman collection?

   - the API pages are autogenerated from the stoplight yaml files placed in the `./static/api` folder. You can create as many API pages as you want by placing your yaml files in this folder. The API pages are generated in the `./src/pages/api` folder.
   - Different postman collection? It has to be manually done, by creating new pages or by passing new parameters to the URL that gonna defined which postman collection to use. _(this is not implemented in the application)_!

3. How to update top nav items and drop downs?

   - The top nav items are defined in the `docusaurus.config.js` file. You can find it in the line `116`
   - an example for a simple item is:

     ```js
        {
         label: "Guides",
         to: "guides",
         position: "left",
         className: "new-badge",
       },
     ```

   - an example of a dropdown:

     ```js
         {
             label: "SDKs",
             type: "dropdown",
             className: "my-website-dropdown",
             items: [
                 {
                 type: "html",
                 value: sdksHTML,
                 className: "my-website-dropdown",
                 },
             ],
             }
     ```

4. How do I update the docusaurus template in my own?

   - You can find the docusaurus template in the `./src` folder. All `Reactjs` pages are rendered from the `pages` folder.
   - You can find the docusaurus components in the `./src/components` folder.
   - You can update the default docusaurus components in the `./src/theme` folder.

5. fiv-1.vercel.app/react-chat-sdk Chat &gt; SDKs &gt; React, So how do we add these per section?

   Same as [https://fiv-1.vercel.app/first-first-category](https://fiv-1.vercel.app/first-first-category) with
   [https://fiv-1.vercel.app/first-second-category](https://fiv-1.vercel.app/first-second-category) ...

   I guess the **Chat**, **SDKs** and **React**, each one gonna has its own versions list, so it's required that each one has its own folder with the versioned docs and versioned sidebars. Means each one with its own path.

6. https://fiv-1.vercel.app/chat/sdk/react (and not https://fiv-1.vercel.app/react-chat-sdk)

   - Gonna required too much work, while we can't use the default docusaurus navigation behavior,
